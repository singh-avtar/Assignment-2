A program for the management of motorbikes in C++
The employee shall be able to manage the customers and make reservations of the motorbikes. The customer can only reserve one motorcycle at a time. There are 4 motorbikes to choose from: "Suzuki Bandit", "Honda TransAlp", "BMW F 650 GS" and "Kawasaki ZZR1400". Make sure that a motorbike is not reserved twice. When making the reservation, the customer has to enter his/her name, first name, address (street, postal code, city), year of birth, telephone number and whether he/she has a Class A driving license. If he/she does not hold an A driving licence, no motorcycle can be reserved. Once the motorcycle has been handed over, the reservation for this customer will be cancelled.
